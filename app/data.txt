UST Cyber Security Solutions
Security Services
Building a cyber-resilient business shouldn’t hinder digital innovation.

The burden of security in an ever-changing threat landscape has become one of the greatest inhibitors to the speed and quality of digital initiatives. Threats are sophisticated, dynamic, and invisible. The attack surface is seemingly infinite in a rapidly expanding multi-cloud ecosystem.
Services & Solutions
Our solutions, customized for you

We protect your business with our comprehensive portfolio of consulting, design engineering, implementation, and managed security services so you can focus on business growth. With design, implementation, and support services, our security experts build comprehensive defense in depth security solutions at enterprise scale.

Zero trust

CyberProof MXDR services empower global enterprises to efficiently anticipate, adapt, and respond to cyber threats in cloud-native environments. The CyberProof Defense Center reduces the impact of attacks by detecting & responding to validated incidents quickly across your IT estate. Log data from diverse tooling such as EDR, SIEM, and OT/IoT is growing exponentially. Cyberproof collects and centralizes visibility of log data to improve analytics, insights, and responsiveness. We’ll also replace siloed legacy security tools, optimize processes, and significantly reduce the costs of log data storage.
Learn more

The threat landscape continually evolves, and so should your security architecture and technologies. The SOC is the heartbeat of a resilient business, providing insights learned from the 24x7x365 fight against bad actors. Our CyberProof security experts assess and reassess your environment to inform your security roadmap.  We aim to improve cyber resiliency and identify elements in your unique security stack that no longer provide value and can therefore be decommissioned to save costs.

CyberProof security services safeguard IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS infrastructure across the enterprise IT ecosystem. We centralize monitoring and management, providing visibility across clouds and cloud-native architectures such as microservices, Kubernetes clusters, and containers. Real-time assessments identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, and remediation is automatically incorporated into operational policies to continuously improve your cloud security posture.

Security shouldn’t be a roadblock for deployment, and CyberProof helps application teams integrate security in every phase of the development lifecycle. After all, shifting security left means no surprises on the right. Code analysis, security testing, and orchestrated vulnerability assessments provide a rich context for prioritizing risks and determining appropriate remediation.

Today’s cyber defense is no longer just about building detection rules. Process automation in a dynamic cloud-native security architecture requires bi-directional API integrations to an expanding list of log data sources, regularly optimized coverage against the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and detection logic that is customized to your top business risks. Our Use Case Engineering service continually identifies and fills gaps in threat detection and response workflows as your landscape evolves.

CyberProof’s data and identity security services enforce zero trust principles to preserve the integrity of the data value chain. Compliance services ensure organizations meet global regulatory standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and SOX. Centralized administration and control of electronic and digital identities reduce risk anywhere resources are located, on-premises and across clouds.

AI is our DNA

AI is woven into the fabric of UST SmartOps. AI, machine learning, and NLP form the basis for many UST SmartOps proprietary pre-configured algorithms. Additional algorithms can be developed as needed using the embedded AI lifecycle management platform.



This agility ensures that the system's capabilities continue to evolve over the lifetime of the systems and maximize return on investment (ROI) while minimizing the total cost of ownership (TCO.)
Contextual voice analysis

UST SmartOps provides the ability to apply AI technology to process and analyze recorded voice data, not merely transcribing the recording but identifying the different voices heard. The spoken words are grouped by the speaker and placed on a timeline. SmartOps uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract critical information (including the correct context) from the recording. This information ensures that customer interactions comply with specific regulations or identify opportunities for training to enhance performance.
Conduct AI-enabled interactive conversations

Customers, partners, and employees initiate conversations using a wide variety of mechanisms. UST SmartOps understands information arriving via various information channels, including phone (voice), SMS (text), email, browser-based chatbots, or even virtual assistants such as Alexa or Siri. These interactions can be interactive, where a bi-directional conversation identifies a specific business activity that needs to occur. The input channel need not be a human-originated request but may also respond to a request from another information system, such as an IT Support ticketing system.



By seamlessly integrating manual and automated tasks, UST SmartOps ensures that processes get smarter through machine learning and enable your people to concentrate on those tasks that add the most business value.
Actionable insights from structured / semi-structured / unstructured data

UST SmartVision, the Intelligent Document Processing capability of the UST SmartOps platform, transforms the data within structured, semi-structured, and unstructured documents into data-driven actionable insights. These insights are generated leveraging advanced AI algorithms and technologies, including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and machine/deep learning, and can drive impactful business outcomes. SmartVision offers multilingual data extraction and Straight Through Processing to reduce overall document processing time. It also provides Document Understanding Analytics, which helps measure the ROI from your IDP initiative.
Contextual document analysis via computer vision

UST SmartOps not only processes structured documents, e.g., invoices, but is also capable of analyzing more complex documents, e.g., legal contracts, where the context of the information is as important as the text itself. UST SmartOps utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the informational context, i.e., not just what the data is but also what it means.



For example, a real estate leasing agreement will contain many different dates and timeframes. By analyzing the entire text of the agreement, UST SmartOps can determine dates and time frames relating to; the beginning of the lease, the duration of the lease and the Opt-out/Opt-in deadlines.



This ability to comprehend large and complex documents can minimize errors and reduce the costs of preparing and modifying these types of business records.
Intelligent monitoring via a single pane of glass

The increasing complexity of IT architecture and its critical role in maintaining business operations has resulted in the monitoring of this landscape transforming into a mission-critical business activity. UST SmartOps provides a single pane of glass to monitor all IT infrastructure; software applications, hardware, and even IoT-enabled devices.



IoT has led to a dramatic increase in the volume of information generated and the monitoring required. AI-enabled monitoring can react automatically to events and preempt them by recognizing patterns in the changing data, recommending, or even taking action to minimize the issue's impact before it becomes a more severe problem.
Manage processes via a single pane of glass

UST SmartOps collects comprehensive process execution metrics. A single pane of glass displaying the entire process's performance. UST SmartOps also exploit its AI capabilities to autonomously invoke business actions in response to this rapidly changing business information.



UST SmartOps analytics can also include data from external systems, e.g., ERP, provide and complete, aggregated view of the business processes under management. For deployments with an existing reporting infrastructure, UST SmartOps seamlessly integrates into 3rd party data analytics platforms.
Manage your processes from one end to the other

The execution of business processes includes tasks carried out by people, applications, and IoT–enabled devices. UST SmartOps provides the holistic management of the entire process, coordinating all of these different moving parts to create processes that, though AI, think for themselves.



By seamlessly integrating manual and automated tasks, UST SmartOps ensures that processes get smarter through machine learning and enable your people to concentrate on those tasks that add the most business value.
Enrich RPA with intelligent automation

Only 7 percent of companies have progressed into enriching their robotic process automation (RPA) with intelligent automation, according to ISG Research. The UST SmartOps intelligent automation platform enables organizations to take that next step.



UST SmartOps seamlessly integrates with existing RPA investments while also providing a native RPA capability. This capability ensures that your current investment is protected while delivering maximum flexibility for future deployments

Insights at Warp Speed using XCL with UST IQ

Limitations of ETL & ELT



ETL is structured but limiting, and ELT can easily turn your data lake into a data swamp. These approaches have in common the first step, Extraction, i.e., copying the data from its current location so you can work on it. This is very time-consuming and expensive.



eXplore. Choose, Load



A new approach is required that empowers users to eXplore data where it resides, Choose which data they want to work with, and then Load it for analysis. This XCL represents a “Shift-Left” Data Pipeline paradigm bringing all users who wish to interact with data and derive faster, relevant insights much closer to the data and insights they are striving to derive.



Insights at Warp Speed



UST IQ enables organizations to explore their data in situ, delivering insights at warp speed! The UST IQ platform provides direct access to the data where it resides and avoids the creation of data swamps. So whether you have a Data Lake, Fabric, or Mesh, learn how to XCL and accelerate your data’s time to value!

Insights Studio

Data Explorer is purpose built to address a need we often see overlooked. The ability to perform exploratory data analysis prior to developing data pipelines. Building and hydrating a data lake or a data warehouse, without understanding the need for the specific data being ingested results in a data swamp.



By being able to explore data across relational and non-relational data sources using ANSI standard SQL, without moving the data, provides data analysts and data engineers, an ability to make informed decisions in designing analytics use cases, and data pipelines.

Ingest facilitates the rapid transfer of data from source to target. Once you have identified the data that you need, you want to acquire it in the lake house for further processing. Ingest, powered by an MPP architecture, can transfer large volumes between source and target in minutes, compared to hours and days. With a built-in integration with Data Explorer, Ingest can also perform data transformation during migration.

Fire is a no-code IDE, for the development of Spark based workflows. With over 350 processors, and a drag-drop interface, Fire facilitates the development of very complex Workflows. A unique code processor allows for developing highly custom applications.

Qubz leverages the power of precompute and multidimensional indexes, to enable interactive analytics over petabytes of data. The general paradigm of doing use case specific ETL to power analytics can be eliminated.
